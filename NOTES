TODO:
1. Link the database and the queries all and for once
2. See if it is able to get the table
3. Make customer repository with customer service
4. See where all databases have to be
5. Difference between date of ticketCreated and availability date for customer as well (to be implemented later)
6. Change structure for the consultant date
7. Do we require to return a list of Consultants in the first place or is one consultant fine
8. When a consultant becomes free later, ie a ticketCreated was cancelled
9. Revisit ticketCreated and see if we want to pass on created status

Questions:
1. Ticket entity and ticketCreated event
2. Do we write join queries in Entities? JPA queries
3. Ticket being used TicketAssigned, TicketStatus, Customer
ticketCreated routing and then the routing
- you need customer and service
- they're different services also
- you might have start with those services
- would need these objects
- or one more option the routing service need not exist, it could api inside the consultant service
- it consultant service
- consumed the ticketCreated created
- created fire it that consultant
4. How to make sure a consultant is available in real time?
   - For now we are assuming that the data is correct and the data is up to date.
